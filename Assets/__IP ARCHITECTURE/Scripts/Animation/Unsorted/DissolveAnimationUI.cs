/// (values, durations, easing, return-to-rest) and only changes where the materials come from:
/// UI Graphics (Image / RawImage / TMP text) instead of Renderers.
///
/// A Graphic is NOT a Renderer, so the base class's GetComponentsInChildren&lt;Renderer&gt; sweep
/// never sees it — this is why the plain DissolveAnimation silently does nothing on a Canvas.
/// UI also needs the MasterMatUI variant of the shader, because the canvas shader carries the
/// stencil/mask properties the worldspace MasterMat lacks. Both variants expose the same
/// property names, so the dissolve driving itself is identical.
